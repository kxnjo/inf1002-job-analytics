Your project will be based at the host organisations offices in Palermo, Buenos Aires.

With a relatively short working week (about 18 hours) under the direction of an English-speaking coordinator, youll have plenty of time to explore the culture of this large and exciting South American country.

The program is designed to fit around you, to best take advantage of your owns skills and interests, as well as the skills youd like to develop further. A weekly or monthly agenda is agreed depending on your and the NGO needs, and your progress is evaluated at weekly mentoring and coaching sessions.

This project, sponsored by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, assessed the global situation of critical information infrastructures. These are defined as networks run by the state or by organisations performing functions vital to society stability, such as banks, healthcare or policing. Identifying these CIIs is the first step to assessing risk of cybercrime on society.First Directory of Technology for Social Development. This project is ongoing and seeks to maintain an open database of relevant technologies. The directory will help stalling technology programs continue by attracting new backers or support.Interactive Exposition: Visions about technology. Interns have contributed to the running of a series of intensive workshops where local participants, such as artists, can be trained up in tricky Information and Communications Technology (ICT) concepts that theyd not normally be exposed to, such as techno-politics, digital rights and internet freedom. The best outcomes from these workshops were made available in a free and interactive exposition for the community. Check the images above to see how it turned out.
