Your project will be based at the host organisations offices in Palermo, Buenos Aires.

With a relatively short working week (about 18 hours) under the direction of an English-speaking coordinator, youll have plenty of time to explore the culture of this large and exciting South American country.

The program is designed to fit around you, to best take advantage of your owns skills and interests, as well as the skills youd like to develop further. A weekly or monthly agenda is agreed depending on your and the NGO needs, and your progress is evaluated at weekly mentoring and coaching sessions.

This project, sponsored by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, assessed the global situation of critical information infrastructures. These are defined as networks run by the state or by organisations performing functions vital to society stability, such as banks, healthcare or policing. Identifying these CIIs is the first step to assessing risk of cybercrime on society.First Directory of Technology for Social Development. This project is ongoing and seeks to maintain an open database of relevant technologies. The directory will help stalling technology programs continue by attracting new backers or support.Interactive Exposition: Visions about technology. Interns have contributed to the running of a series of intensive workshops where local participants, such as artists, can be trained up in tricky Information and Communications Technology (ICT) concepts that theyd not normally be exposed to, such as techno-politics, digital rights and internet freedom. The best outcomes from these workshops were made available in a free and interactive exposition for the community. Check the images above to see how it turned out.

Summary
 
Do you love how it feels to encourage others? As a Specialist, you help create the energy and excitement around Apple products, providing the right solutions and getting products into customers’ hands. You understand that the Apple Store is dedicated to delivering a customer experience that’s unlike any other. It starts with you discovering customers’ needs. And with the support of your store team members, you match those needs with the right products. Every day is an opportunity for you to turn another Apple Store visitor into a loyal Apple customer.

Description
 
As a Specialist, you’re highly skilled at uncovering customers’ needs, then following through with enlightening solutions. Not only are you the first person customers meet when they enter the store, but you’re also the person who guides them — advising, selling, and even setting up their new products. You perform other roles within the store too, whether it’s maintaining visual merchandising or assisting team members. Always curious, you stay on top of news about products and initiatives, ready to apply your learning in customer interactions. Your success is measured by team and individual productivity as well as overall store performance. You’re proud to represent Apple, and you get great satisfaction from helping customers develop lifelong relationships with Apple. 


Discover even more benefits of doing what you love. Apple’s most important resource, our soul, is our people. Apple benefits help further the well-being of our employees and their families in meaningful ways. No matter where you work at Apple, you can take advantage of our health and wellness resources and time-away programs. We’re proud to provide stock grants to employees at all levels of the company, and we also give employees the option to buy Apple stock at a discount — both offer everyone at Apple the chance to share in the company’s success. You’ll discover many more benefits of working at Apple, such as programs that match your charitable contributions, reimburse you for continuing your education, and give you special employee pricing on Apple products.


Note: Apple benefits programs vary by country and are subject to eligibility requirements.
