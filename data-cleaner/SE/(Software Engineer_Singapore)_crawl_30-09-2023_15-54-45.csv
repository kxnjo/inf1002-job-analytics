Software Engineer – Backend,3696161433,Padlet,"Singapore, Singapore (On-site)",276,Entry level,Full-time,Engineering:Information Technology,Software Development,"Padlet is building software for a good education. A good education is one that inspires curiosity, creativity, and community. Our software enables that through visual content creation and collaboration in millions of classrooms worldwide.

We are looking for Backend Engineers to deliver on our promise. Cloud makes it possible for any human to have access to supercomputers. We need you to program these supercomputers to improve the lives of a billion people.

Responsibilities
Building new features. E.g. building our public API so our users can extend Padlet. Improving backend performance. E.g. making network calls faster and more reliable. Making the backend more cost efficient. E.g. reducing the CPU and memory requirements of services. Improving how we work. E.g. improving our internationalization tooling we use to translate our app into 40+ languages. 

Qualifications
At some point in your life, someone has told you: “you write good code.”You know how to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow. Bonus: you have a good sense of humor. 

About Padlet
Vision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet. Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product. Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet. Money: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years. Badassery: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here. 

Tech stack
Backend: Ruby (Rails), Typescript, Elixir (Phoenix), and Python. Storage: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake. Web: VueJS, Tailwind. Mobile apps: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.)

Joys of engineering at Padlet
We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow. A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting real-time collaboration problems. Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems. We like to craft delightful user experiences. They’re satisfying to build. We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them. We ship often. We value beautiful code. 

Sorrows of engineering at Padlet
We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We’re working on it!Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We’re working on it!

Some people you‘d be working with
Linh Nguyen: At any given point, no one really knows where Linh is. We learn of his existence through pull requests and code reviews. Frontend maestro. Brian Koh: Only human we know who has impulsive urges to exercise. When he does, he doesn't care about outfits. We've seen him running in boots, tight jeans, and leather jackets. Exceptional engineer and even better mentor. 

Benefits
Top tier medical insurance for you and your family. Good stock options. Catered lunches and dinners. 20 vacation days. Plus sickness and bereavement days for when life happens. All the gadgetry you need, including a new phone every year. 

Special time to join

What We Do
Our Software Engineers are end-to-end owners who have the opportunity to participate in many aspects of designing, building, and delivering data-focused products for our stakeholders.
At The Trade Desk, we believe that each opportunity to engage with consumers is unique. User experience can make or break our business. This means our users must have all the flexibility to harness our system’s growing power and present meaningful insight from the petabytes of data streaming through our platform with unparalleled ease.
Our system performs every day, 24/7, serving global traffic. We deliver features to improve our clients' abilities to make real-time decisions and troubleshoot campaigns with simple-to-use interfaces and high-performance data interactions. To improve our users’ day-to-day lives, we collaborate closely with user experience and product management organizations to ensure consistent, modern designs as well as the right balance of requirements. Our frontend developers work up and down the stack (client to server) to deliver these world-class experiences.
Some of the work that you will be doing to help us deliver on our mission is:

We are a global team with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be well-versed in building from common ground to value, seek out, and foster invisible and visible dimensions of diversity.
Who you are:
Our culture is much deeper than just having fun together (though we do that well, too). We take pride in our engineers being trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.
You do not have to meet all the requirements below, but we believe that people who meet most of them will have a higher likelihood of succeeding in this role:
 You are comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents. You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences. You have a solid understanding of computer science and engineering fundamentals. You are passionate about building beautiful and seamless user interfaces. You have love for, and desire to advance, the state of the art of technology. You are proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript. You have experience building enterprise level services. You have 7+ years of software development, engineering experience. You have a Bachelor’s/Master’s level degree in computer sciences or relevant engineering-related field or equivalent experience. Not everyone has the same level of access to opportunities. What is most important to us is what and how you can contribute, which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have. You have additional nice-to-have experience that is not required in the following areas: languages/technology on the server-side (C#, Java, NodeJS, SQL), knowledge of front-end frameworks (React/Redux).
A variety of technical opportunities is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a software engineer, which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and find solutions to complex problems using the optimum tools for the job. What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We are not seeking engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent answers no one has thought of yet and find answers to the questions yet to be asked
The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs.
