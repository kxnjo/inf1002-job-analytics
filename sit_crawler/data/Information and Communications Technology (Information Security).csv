Computer Organization and Architecture,https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/modules/computer-organisation-and-architecture,Computer Organisation and Architecture,"This is a foundation module whose main focus is on the characteristics and development of relatively high level ‘building’ blocks of a computer system. The highest level learning objective is to make clear how a computer program written in text is actually ‘executed’ by a computer, regardless of it being a mainframe, desktop or embedded system. A myriad of basic lower-level topics include explaining how a central processor operates, the characteristics of different memory subsystems, data representations and measurements of system performance will be covered. To ensure in-depth coverage of the topics, students will be exposed to assembly language programming and may be given the opportunity to experiment with a micro-controller based system during the course of the module.

Change Management,https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/modules/change-management-1,Change Management,"Through this module, students will develop an understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by changes in science, technology, society and organizations. Popular narratives related to the disciplines of science and technology, such as improvements to how we do things because of technological advancements, or benefits to health because of scientific development, often frame these disciplines as both providing and based upon absolute truth, and formed through singular evolutions. Such narratives present current advancements in science and technology as unproblematic and inevitable processes of evolution. These narratives often fail to take into account alternative narratives and social, political and cultural reasons for the changes, and as such present the reader a view that is, at best, static, and at worst, prejudiced. In recent years, scholars have repeatedly demonstrated that science and technology are as fluid and malleable as the people who produce them.
Through a focus on three themes of “Social Change”, “Organizational Change” and “Individual Change”, students will develop an understanding of how change occurs, why it occurs, and what we can do to anticipate, encourage and manage change, contextualized to healthcare and social care. Students will think about and discuss a range of benefits that managing and understanding change may contribute to their lives, the organizations in which they work, and society as a whole."
Secure Software Development,https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/modules/secure-software-development,Secure Software Development,"As more organisations are dependent upon the software for their operations, insecure software can be one of the biggest threat that may cripple an entire organisation and potentially lead to massive losses."
