Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?
At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.
Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.
This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.
Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you’ll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products:
Crossover - an AI-powered hiring platform that sifts through millions of applicants per year to find the top 1% of global remote talent.gt.school - an online education platform that uses advanced data collection, algorithms, and AI-generated content to empower students to learn at their own pace.Data-driven Sales - an initiative that leverages data and AI algorithms to streamline the sales process across a portfolio of over 100 software products.
We're on the brink of an exhilarating journey with generative AI, and we want you to be a part of it. If you're eager to pioneer this transformation and play a pivotal role in the AI-driven future of software development, Trilogy is the place for you.
What You Will Be Doing
Proposing and conducting experiments with generative AI to enhance engineering processes, including problem decomposition, solution design, code generation, and advanced troubleshooting.Documenting best practices and techniques in playbooks and guides that enable others to harness the power of generative AI effectively.Using AI tools and techniques to develop and roll out actual features and products.Adopting, testing, and aggressively integrating new technologies, and standardizing a tech stack that genuinely boosts productivity.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Developing completely new AI models - we are focusing our attention on reusing and/or finetuning existing models instead. Engaging in academic exercises without tangible outcomes or failing to deliver features and products.Getting stuck on a stagnant tech stack that neither changes nor innovates.
Basic Requirements
AI-Augmented Software Developer key responsibilities
Minimum 5 years of experience in software development.Minimum 3 years as a primary technical contributor for a development team or software product.Extensive hands-on experience using generative AI for software engineering tasks or in a product you built.

About Padlet
Vision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet. Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product. Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet. Money: We are venture backed AND profitable.

Sorrows of engineering at Padlet
We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We’re working on it!Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We’re working on it!
