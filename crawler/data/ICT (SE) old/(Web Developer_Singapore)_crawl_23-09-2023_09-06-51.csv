Senior Full-stack Software Engineer,3674423881,Knoetic | CPOHQ,"Singapore, Singapore (Hybrid)",246,Mid-Senior level,Full-time,Engineering,Software Development,"Hello, we’re Knoetic (<-rhymes with “poetic” 😊)!
We've raised over $50MM from Accel, EQT Ventures, Menlo, and 100s of angels (like Adam Grant). 
Why did these world-class VCs and angels want in on Knoetic? 
Because we’re building a “brain” for Chief People Officers that enables them to build healthy, productive, equitable workforces – and ultimately shapes the future of work. 
How does it work? The “left brain” is Knoetic Analytics – the quantitative insights. We integrate with HR systems (HRIS, recruiting platforms, performance platforms, etc), ingest all that disparate employee data, manipulate it via a complex transform process, and then push insights back to the customer in a user-friendly way. Chief People Officers use Knoetic Analytics to visualize their workforce, prepare for Board meetings, influence their executive team, workforce plan, uncover performance trends, and much more. The “right brain” is CPOHQ – the qualitative insights. Chief People Officers join our executive community to tap the wisdom of their peers, find best practices, workshop pressing business challenges, and make meaningful connections. The role of the CPO has never been more complex, and CPOHQ is where they turn to inform the decisions that impact their employees. 
By bringing Analytics & CPOHQ together, we give CPOs and their People teams a holistic view of what drives employees to come, stay, and feel valued at work. This is a platform unlike any other.
That’s where you come in!

With a presence in nine markets and serving nearly 600 users globally, Accredify has processed over 12 million verifications on 2 million issued documents, known as ""Accredified documents"". Led by a dedicated team that embraces the highest standards of customer service, security, and privacy, Accredify's mission is to be the foremost verification solutions provider for moments when trust matters most.

All digital documents issued by Accredify's cloud-based system are tamper-evident and traceable to source. To verify documents, users simply have to drag and drop the document file into an online verifier portal or scan a QR code; results are instantaneous.

The core value proposition of Accredify's solution is the simplification of complex processes through automation and verified data. Designed with data portability and systems interoperability in mind, our verification technology is fit-for-every purpose.
