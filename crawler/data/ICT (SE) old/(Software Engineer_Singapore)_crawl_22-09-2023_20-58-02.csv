Thales people architect solutions that are relied upon to deliver operational advantage at every decisive moment throughout the mission. Defence and armed forces customers rely on us to deliver the full range of defensive systems for land, sea, and air. From early warning, to threat neutralisation, our platforms cover all levels from very short-range systems, to extended protection across the entire battle-space including Airspace Mobility Solutions, Vehicles and Tactical Systems and Missile Defence, Optronics, and Radar.

Thales established its presence in Singapore in 1973 to support the expansion of aerospace-related activities in the Asia-Pacific region. Throughout the last four decades, the company grew from strength to strength and is today involved in the primary businesses of Aerospace (including Air Traffic Management), Defence & Security, Ground Transportation and Digital Identity & Security. Thales today employs over 2,100 people in Singapore across all its business areas.

The Aviation Innovation Research (AIR) Lab

The joint CAAS-Thales innovation lab known as ‘AIR Lab’ started to operate on 1st November 2019 with the objective to develop Proof of Concepts (POCs) or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) of advanced and open technologies for future Air Traffic Management (ATM). Currently, the joint lab employs a team of 40 Thales engineers and 12 CAAS engineers and air traffic controllers operating in a vibrant ecosystem involving a number of Singaporean SMEs and start-ups, as well as key research institutes.

Thales engineers include 10 domain experts – with more than 10 years of experience – coming from Thales ATM centres of competence in France and Australia. These experts are coaching both the local Thales and CAAS engineers.

The POCs and MVPs are co-developed with the CAAS engineers who have access to the same development tools and environment used by the Thales Engineers (provided by the Singapore branch of Thales Digital Factory). The POCs and MVPs are defined in collaboration with CAAS air traffic controllers through iterative workshops.

AIR Lab research outcomes will feed the next generation of products, including clearly disruptive outcomes addressing Safety and Security for Open architecture, data driven ATM Twin, Green Aviation, Trajectory Based Operations.

As the AIR Lab was recently extended for another 3 years, 4 work streams are now embarked:

Regional Experimental Platform, FF-ICE/TBO, Green Aviation, Future-proof Interoperable Platform-Agnostic, Safe and Secure Platforms.

AIR Lab 2.0 continues to benefit from research conducted in Europe through new architecture research which, among other objectives, aims at meeting much stricter safety standards for ground ATM systems in development by the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA). This breakthrough architecture study is co-funded by the French government (CASSIOPEA).

Regional Experimental Platform (REP) has been initiated in AIR Lab 1.0, and has the view to addressing regional needs in coordination with the SESAR 3 activities conducted in AMS France.
