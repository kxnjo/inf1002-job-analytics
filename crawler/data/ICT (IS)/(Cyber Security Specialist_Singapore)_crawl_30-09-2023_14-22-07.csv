Identifying Internet-Accessible Critical Information Infrastructure. This project, sponsored by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, assessed the global situation of critical information infrastructures. These are defined as networks run by the state or by organisations performing functions vital to society stability, such as banks, healthcare or policing. Identifying these CIIs is the first step to assessing risk of cybercrime on society.First Directory of Technology for Social Development. This project is ongoing and seeks to maintain an open database of relevant technologies. The directory will help stalling technology programs continue by attracting new backers or support.Interactive Exposition: Visions about technology. Interns have contributed to the running of a series of intensive workshops where local participants, such as artists, can be trained up in tricky Information and Communications Technology (ICT) concepts that theyd not normally be exposed to, such as techno-politics, digital rights and internet freedom. The best outcomes from these workshops were made available in a free and interactive exposition for the community. Check the images above to see how it turned out.
