About

If youd like to know more about areas of work on this technology and cybercrime project, here are some examples of projects that are either ongoing or have been completed recently by participants
Identifying Internet-Accessible Critical Information Infrastructure. This project, sponsored by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, assessed the global situation of critical information infrastructures. These are defined as networks run by the state or by organisations performing functions vital to society stability, such as banks, healthcare or policing. Identifying these CIIs is the first step to assessing risk of cybercrime on society.First Directory of Technology for Social Development. This project is ongoing and seeks to maintain an open database of relevant technologies. The directory will help stalling technology programs continue by attracting new backers or support.Interactive Exposition: Visions about technology. Interns have contributed to the running of a series of intensive workshops where local participants, such as artists, can be trained up in tricky Information and Communications Technology (ICT) concepts that theyd not normally be exposed to, such as techno-politics, digital rights and internet freedom. The best outcomes from these workshops were made available in a free and interactive exposition for the community. Check the images above to see how it turned out.

Team Introduction: 
The Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) works with public sector agencies in using data science and AI to improve policy outcomes, service delivery and operational efficiency. We extract data-driven insights and build intelligent platforms to add value to the work of our partner agencies.  We also help public sector agencies transform by partnering them in building data science expertise, formulating data strategies and setting up the necessary data infrastructure.
 
How do we work: 
 Outcome Driven - Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what” and make sure that our findings and models can be translated into tangible impact.
Start Small and Move Fast - We build things quickly. If it works, good — how can we scale this up further? If not, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
Ownership - You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.
Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged but essential.
We are in this Together - We draw from the deep domain knowledge of our partners and best practices from our community of experts.

How do we work: 
The Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) works with public sector agencies in using data science and AI to improve policy outcomes, service delivery and operational efficiency. We extract data-driven insights and build intelligent platforms to add value to the work of our partner agencies.  We also help public sector agencies transform by partnering them in building data science expertise, formulating data strategies and setting up the necessary data infrastructure.
 Outcome Driven - Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what” and make sure that our findings and models can be translated into tangible impact. Start Small and Move Fast - We build things quickly. If it works, good — how can we scale this up further? If not, what went wrong and what can we do better next time? Ownership - You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it. Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged but essential. We are in this Together - We draw from the deep domain knowledge of our partners and best practices from our community of experts.
